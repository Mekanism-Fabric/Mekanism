# Mekanism for Minecraft 1.17 #

Mekanism is a Minecraft add-on featuring high-tech machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, 
armor, and weapons. You can find more detail on the features at the [**Official Website**](http://aidancbrady.com/mekanism/).
Mekanism is an independent tech mod that brings low, mid, and high tier machinery to Minecraft. The 
mod doesn't have an actual goal, and you'll understand this when you see all the random content 
Mekanism contains, from jetpacks to balloons. However, I can assure you that you'll notice all the 
content blend together as you get to know the mod better!

Mekanism uses a tier-based system when organizing several of its core features, including Energy 
Cubes and Factories. There are four tiers: basic, the simplest tier, advanced, the second-most basic 
tier, elite, the second-most complex tier, and ultimate, the most complex tier. You can upgrade 
tiers by placing the component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources 
for the next upgrade.

By the time you've been using Mekanism for a while, you'll have a near-indestructible suit of Obsidian 
Armor, be obtaining five ingots for each ore you mine, have the ability to fly wherever you want with 
the hydrogen-powered jetpacks, and have a cute robotic friend following you around while you mine. :)
